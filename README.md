# slides-fetcher
This script is for fetching slides for some courses I've taken at MSOE from a certain professor.

This script is specific to their webpages and will dump all the downloaded pdfs/links into a directory created from the scrapped page.

### Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/austinrovge/slides-fetcher.git
$ cd slides-fetcher
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
